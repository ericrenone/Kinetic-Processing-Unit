# Identity-Geometry

**Fisher-Rao information geometry + rational inattention novelty scoring for LLM outputs.**

Lightweight, research-grade Python library for computing **novelty and information density** in language models. Provides reproducible **diagonal Fisher trace**, **KL divergence**, and a **novelty functional** that combines both measures.
